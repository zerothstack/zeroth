# Core Module

## Overview
Zeroth is a full stack Angular 2 framework. It uses the Angular 2 dependency injection pattern to bring good design patterns
 to the backend. Zeroth is an isomorphic framework, which means that components can be built to be shared between the frontend
 and the backend where appropriate. This significantly reduces code duplication and improves development speed. 

See http://zeroth.io for more info on this framework.
 
This repo is for the core module only, and should not be forked to create a new project. To get started with a new Zeroth project,
view the [Quickstart Guide](http://zeroth.io/guide/quick-start/)

## Note
Zeroth is currently in alpha developer preview. Follow https://twitter.com/zeroth for updates, and check the [Roadmap](http://zeroth.io/#roadmap) for current status.
